But how does the relationship between humans and our furry friends work? Scientists have studied the science behind the interaction between cats and dogs and humans.\n \nThe science of pet therapy has been well researched by scientists. Studies have shown that when pets and humans interact, the people involved exhibit lower levels of stress hormones and an increased \"feel good\" hormone. Studies have also shown that petting a dog can decrease anxiety and help the person become more relaxed.\n\nStudies have found that cats are less socially interactive than dogs, but they have their own way of communicating with humans. In some cases, cats can hear a stranger's voice and knew who it belonged to without having ever met them before. Cats have been found to be social learners that rely on visual cues to interpret their environment.\n\nThe science also includes how cats and dogs adapt to their environment. Dogs are found to be social learners and learn from their environment as well as from humans. They may be able to calm a person with their presence and can be trained to do various tasks. Cats on the other hand are more independent animals and stay close to their surroundings. They can pick up behavioral cues from their environment, more than humans, which is why cats can be so entertaining to watch.",

        "instruction": "EZRA KLEIN: And that streetlight is deep learning.\n\nGARY MARCUS: The streetlight is deep learning. And what’s being ignored, I think, is the rest of cognitive science. So deep learning is a very interesting mathematical technique for setting some values in some system based on data. It turns out to be tremendously useful for a bunch of things.\n\nBut it’s only part of what we need. If you take a step back to cognitive science, which is what I was trained on, and you say, well, what is a human mind? Well, part of it is it does some pattern recognition. And some of what deep learning does is at least part of what we do in pattern recognition. So great.\n\nBut you also, if you look at the human mind, there’s a whole bunch of other things going on. So we use language. When we use language, we go from hearing a sentence to building a model in the world of what the other person’s talking to. We use analogies. We plan things and so forth and so on.\n\nThe reality is we’ve only made progress on a tiny bit of the things that go into intelligence. Now I’m not saying that A.I. has to be exactly like a human. In fact, I think humans are pretty flawed, and we don’t want to just replicate humans. We have, for example, confirmation bias where we notice things in favor of our own theories and not against them. We have all kinds of flaws that we might not want to have in our A.I. systems.\n\nBut there are many things that our A.I. systems can do that aren’t part of what’s fashionable right now and are not under that streetlight that everybody’s looking at. So on a technical level, I think there’s a narrowness to what A.I. has been in the last decade, where there’s this wonderful new tool, but people are a little bit misled about what that tool is actually appropriate for. It’s like if you discovered a power screwdriver and you’d never had one before, that’d be great. But that doesn’t mean that you build the house just with your power screwdriver. And we need other tools here.\n\nThen culturally, and this relates — there’s been a history that’s actually much older than I am, goes back to the 1940s or ’50s depending on how you want to count it — of people who build neural networks in conflict with people who take a more classical approach to A.I., where there’s lots of symbols and trees and databases and reasoning and so forth.\n\nAnd there’s a pendulum that’s gone back and forth. People in the two areas pretty much hate each other, or at least often do. I think it’s getting a little bit better. But there’s a lot of history of hostility between these two areas. So the people with the bigger streetlight right now are the people building the neural networks. And they feel like they’ve been oppressed by the symbolic people, and now they’re oppressing the symbolic people. There’s an old phrase, the victim becomes the victimizer.\n\nSo it’s not a pleasant intellectual area like some fields that I’ve seen. Of course, they’re not always pleasant. But there is definitely a culture right now where the people who are in power and have a lot of money are really trying to shape the decisions around what gets researched and what doesn’t.\n\nEZRA KLEIN: Take a moment and explain what symbol manipulation is because I don’t think that the term for it is very intuitive.\n\nGARY MARCUS: So symbols are just things that stand for other things. And manipulating just means you do stuff with them. So algebra is actually symbol manipulation. So you have an equation like y equals x plus 2. And you have variables in that like y and x. And then you can set those variables to particular instances. So I can say that x is 3. Then I can calculate the value of y from that equation.\n\nSo we do it in algebra. We do it in logic. And linguists like Noam Chomsky would say that we do it in the course of understanding language. It’s also essential to computer programming. Almost everything you see in a computer program is going to be a function that takes variables. You do something with those variables. The variables are symbols. The values that you set those variables are symbols.\n\nThere’s a whole tradition. Most of the world’s software is, in fact, built using software that manipulates symbols, where you describe things abstractly. You also have things like databases, and those databases are symbols. And neural networks have mostly been used as an alternative to that. And they’ve been very effective in some things like speech recognition. But on the other hand, nobody would build a GPS system or a web browser or a word processor using pure neural network approach. Anybody would use mostly symbols for that.\n\nAnd there’s this weird argument, weird discourse where people who like the neural network stuff mostly don’t want to use symbols. What I’ve been arguing for 30 years, since I did my dissertation with Steve Pinker at M.I.T. studying children’s language, has been for some kind of hybrid where we use neural networks for the things they’re good at, and use the symbol stuff for the things they’re good at, and try to find ways to bridge these two traditions.\nSummarize this",

        "instruction": "so I want to take a couple minutes to talk to you about growth and really the issue is sustainable growth and whether you're a fast-growing insurgent from an emerging market or a very established incumbent multinational one of the things that we've discovered and really looked at on the question of growth is this topic of do you still have the founders mentality and what I want to do is to try to define that and talk about some of the things that happens to companies that blows them off track from retaining that founders mentality Bain has been looking at the issue of how companies grow sustainably for at least 40 years and one of the things that's quite fascinating is when you look at the the annual reports of the global 2000 on average the leaders of those companies are projecting to outgrow their markets by two times that's on a revenue basis and on a profit basis to grow to outgrow their markets by four times and so it's a reasonable question to ask on any sustained basis over a 10-year period how many companies actually outgrow their market by two times and the answer is roughly one in tenth and that means 90% of companies are going to fail to achieve their basic growth ambitions and when you ask about that 90% and you say what was it that led to the failure for you to sustain that growth the fascinating thing is only in roughly 15% of cases to the management team site the markets they don't blame the markets when they look and reflect on what happened they mostly cite internal issues be it their organizational complexity what's happened to their culture inability to get resources at the right point of attack etc etc and this has led to us in the way we think about growth to say it isn't simply how you compete in the market how you drive to leadership there is something that happens internally as companies grow that either lead to their success or lead to their downfall and we talk about it on two dimensions and we say first to what degree is the company still retaining its sense of founders mentality and to what degree is the company benefiting from the scale and scope that comes with growth and what we see is in most cases companies start as fantastic insurgents very high founders mentality no scale and scope whatsoever but as they grow the default path is they move into incumbency gaining huge benefits of scale and scope but losing that original insurgent culture by definition one of the main things that you lose is founder mentality and that's huge founder lead companies are insurgents they are at war against their industry on behalf of a dissatisfied customer and this leads to sort of extraordinary sense of nobler mission a long-term view of what you're doing with the company the other thing you lose is the owner mindset owner mindset is this incredible cost mentality everything everything is your money it is this notion of being absolutely bias to action hatred of bureaucracy and it's this personalization of risk it's your money so it's quite interesting we found out that companies they're much more likely to pilot a lot but then if they've got a winning proposition they're going to bet it all in contrast incumbents large multinationals will pilot a lot but then never actually back a bet they'll just continue to spend a little money everywhere rather than betting it all on something that's working and the final definition is this obsession with the front line that means their talent obsessed customer obsessed advocacy obsessed and everything is about translating the strategy into frontline behaviors frontline actions one things that we find extraordinary is with incumbents you can work for weeks in discussions about strategy without any leader talking about how it will impact the front line for founder led companies it's incomprehensible to talk about strategy without talking about the front line so that is a huge amount to lose culturally on the other hand you're growing and you're gaining from the benefits of scale and scope so let's investigate what you gain first leadership economics who wouldn't want to be a leader in their industry with extraordinary opportunity to put purchasing pressure on the supplier to be able to give customers more in more you begin to gain a proprietary set of assets and capabilities you have better brands you have better capabilities with people you have good IT systems that collect customer feedback all extraordinary and you benefit from the economics of scope you're in multiple countries you learn from those countries you can roll out the next product that much faster and that's part of the problem is that the benefits of scale and scope are very real and therefore over that time from insurgency to incumbency the perception may be that the company is continuing to benefit because the benefits of scale and scope overwhelmed the cost of losing founder mentality but now you're in incumbency and now you're a different company you've got tremendous scale and scope but none of that original culture and what we're seeing there is the struggle is now that scale in scope is no longer a benefit it is complexity and it is dragging you south towards a struggling bureaucracy one of the things that we argue is awareness of the winds we refer to these as the westward winds awareness of what are the pressures and lead you on this default path if you understand what is going on you can then develop actions to mitigate that so let's talk about those winds what happens to insurgents that can lead them into this incumbency trap first thing is revenue grows faster than Talent by definition these are fast-growing companies you want your revenue to be growing faster than Talent but what you do during that period to address that can make or break a company the second thing is the erosion of accountability when companies are very small discussions are about real things you talk about customers you talk about the product line profitability and what to do with pricing what to do with cost as companies grow there starts to be the rise of averages so you talk about average customers you talk about one of the most insidious phrases in business average gross margin and people end up in conversations about things that actually have nothing to do with the business they are the math of the business and when you're at that level of abstraction it is no wonder that people no longer feel accountable all for activity because there is no discussion of activity there's a discussion of math then there's this issue of the lost voice of the frontline this is inevitable but it's insidious 20a are making decisions for the company our people that are selling the product and talking to customers every day then two things begin to happen the first of which is you begin to bring in functional professionals for all the right reasons but you have a head of HR you have a head of Finance you have a head of supply chain and these are additional voices around the table and then the business gets complex enough that you don't actually have the front line at the table you have span breakers that you've put in who manage the frontline and you get into a situation where nobody around the table is actually part of the frontline of the business and the voice of the frontline begins to be eroded and very bad things can start happening and then the final thing is the unscalable founder one of the things that we're very clear about in our research is the founder can be the problem the phrase we use is founder mentality not the founder because sometimes the founder himself or herself is the issue one of the westward wins that we've talked about a lot is this issue of revenue grows faster than Talent so we spent a huge amount of time with founder companies and what they say is we don't have a growth problem we have a sustainable growth problem our issue is we can't keep the organization growing and scaling at the pace that our revenue grows and scales and it's this period in this early growth these 10x growth rates that very bad things can start to happen in these companies the first thing is they go through a time of Heroes you're growing like crazy you have very limited talent and guess what happens well heroes step forward and you have heroic things occurring with 26 year olds they do things far beyond what you'd expect them to do and these stories of these heroes jumping into the breach often become some of the foundational stories of the company's history and you see this and you probably have in your own website stories of these people that did amazing things but the fact is eventually these guys get overextended and mistakes start happening and the desire of the original team is somehow now we need to move to a period of professionalization and this has been one of the most important issues that we've seen when we've been working with founders is how do they move to this period of professionalization without destroying the culture and it's very hard and one of the things that occurs is they jump right from unsustainable heroes to flawed systems and a lot of you will see that you've gone through this you're trying to now put in systems as fast as you can you're bringing in professionals but a series of mistakes start happening first is often the original founders are asked to somehow codify their genius they're asked to take all the decision making an instinct and guts they have that drove the business and suddenly begin to put that into paper and to create manuals or create procedures to do what they did and one of the things that the founders have said is I've now suddenly put everything I talked about in the business into a manual and now my company is attracted to people that want to work by a manual who wants that second is they bring big company recruits into the business so they get big brand names people that have run big companies and they bring them in but the problem is these guys have an incumbent mindset they've been administrators of large systems but they've never built the system and so they come in and they're in charge of supply chain and the first thing is by the way we don't have a good supply chain build it and they're saying well I expect a staff of 45 people to administer an existing supply chain not build one from scratch there's a desire to harmonize everything and so this is the notion that we've gone from every comp and bonus decision being made in the hallway by who sees the founder next to the lift to we now need to get to procedures and systems for all the right reasons but this desire to harmonize means that we stop thinking about our talent and start defending our systems over our talent and then what happens is somehow these companies feel they need to recruit like they're an incumbent",
